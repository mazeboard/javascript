implement a stack where

push, pop, and max have O(1) complexity

1. istack.js is an implementation for a stack containing
positive integers; the space overhead is 1bit per entry

2. nstack.js is an implementation for a stack containing
numbers; the space overhead is N in the worst case when the
numbers are entered in ascending order, and the best case is 1
when the numbers are entered in descending order; on average
the space overhead depends on the pattern of how often the 
maximum changes overtime.
